This project is based on worldâ€™s well known social media platform Instagram which is owned by Meta Platforms. It allow users to upload media files like photos and 
video clips on Instagram application andthe posts can be shared publicly or with preapproved followers.
In this project, my role is to analyze the user interactions and engagement with the Instagram application and based on this, provide the valuable insights that can help grow the business.
In order to get the insights from the data, I first need to access the data from the database. So, I have used MySQL Workbench as my tool to retrieve the required data from the database.
